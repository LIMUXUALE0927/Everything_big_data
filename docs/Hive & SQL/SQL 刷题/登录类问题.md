## [180. 连续出现的数字](https://leetcode.cn/problems/consecutive-numbers/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=sql-free-50)

```sql
select distinct t.num as ConsecutiveNums
from (select id,
             num,
             row_number() over (order by id)                  as rn,
             row_number() over (partition by num order by id) as id_rn
      from Logs) t
group by t.num, (t.rn - t.id_rn)
having count(1) >= 3;
```

`rn` 表示原表的行号，`id_rn` 表示按照 `num` 分组后的行号，如果 `rn - id_rn` 相等，说明是连续的数字。
